                  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With experts warning that the Coronavirus pandemic may last well into next year, the urgency of limiting the spread of the virus is sure to increase. Cellphone and social media data will increasingly be viewed as a <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/technology/city-of-toronto-gathering-cellphone-location-data-from-telecoms-in-bid-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19-tory/wcm/5cf36345-e27e-4b02-aa0e-5ddbe90022fd?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1585053601">valuable sources of information</a> for public health authorities, as they seek to identify outbreaks in communities more quickly, rapidly warn people that they may have been exposed to the virus, or enforce quarantine orders. My <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-canada-should-ensure-cellphone-tracking-to-counter-the-spread-of/#comments">Globe and Mail op-ed</a> notes the data culled from these sources may prove invaluable, but they raise exceptionally difficult challenges of balancing public health concerns with fundamental privacy rights.</p>
  <p>Many countries have already moved in this direction. For example, Israel has implemented a system that involves the collection and use of cellphone location data to identify at-risk individuals, who may receive text messages warning that they need to self-quarantine. Taiwan has used cellphone tracking to warn those self-quarantining that they have travelled too far from home with some Indian states adopting similar measures.</p>
  <p>In normal times, most Canadians would respond to the collection and use of sensitive health and location information with a hard no. But these are not normal times. The trade-offs between public health and privacy, not to mention the massive impact being felt by millions as the economy grinds to a halt, means that all measures can and should be considered in response to the global pandemic. In other words, rather than asking whether to use the data, the question is likely to be under what circumstances and with what safeguards and oversight.</p>
  <p>There are at least three types of data that may be collected and used to counter the spread of Coronavirus. The first is aggregated data that could be used to identify trends such as community outbreaks. Provided that it is aggregated in a sufficiently large pool, this data does not involve personally identifiable information and would not typically trigger Canadian privacy law requirements.</p>
  <p>While there will still be concerns about the use of this data, there are unquestionable benefits that may come from aggregated phone, social media, and search data that could facilitate faster responses to communal health risks. There are reports the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/">United States</a> has been considering this approach and the Canadian government should be working with both telecom and technology companies to ensure the use of such data arises only in appropriate circumstances and with the necessary safeguards in place.</p>
  <p>The second type involves cellphone location data of specific users. Using the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/how-taiwan-is-containing-coronavirus-despite-diplomatic-isolation-by-china">Taiwan model</a>, this data might potentially be used to ensure that self-quarantine rules are properly respected. While users could presumably just leave their phones at home, this form of location data would uncomfortably turn our phones into electronic monitoring devices without user consent.</p>
  <p>The third type would also involve cellphone location data, only this time it would be used to identify other people who may have unknowingly been placed at increased risk by coming into close proximity with someone known to have the virus. This data collection and use – similar to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51930681">Israeli model</a> &#8211; would frequently be retrospective in nature, looking back at the prior two weeks to effectively trace everyone’s movements.</p>
  <p>Given the urgency of addressing the Coronavirus pandemic, there are obvious reasons to use every tool in the policy toolbox, even those that ordinarily raise deeply troubling privacy concerns. Since consent-based models do not work and some data cannot be de-identified or aggregated, the solution for more sensitive location data lies in developing safeguards to ensure that any measures are minimally privacy invasive, temporary, and subject to full oversight.</p>
  <p>These safeguards should include strict limits on data retention, with the location data immediately deleted as soon as the necessary period (presumably 14 days) expires. Moreover, there should be clear limitations on use, ensuring that the data only be used for the enumerated public health purposes. The policies should also feature restrictions on further disclosure, severely limiting access only to trusted individuals within governmental organizations.</p>
  <p>Even with these safeguards, appropriate oversight and penalties are needed. This includes transparency about the policies, public reports on data access and use, real-time oversight from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and tough penalties for any potential violations.</p>
  <p>Perhaps most importantly, these powers must be temporary in nature, requiring parliamentary approval for short term use and regular renewals as events warrant. Given the privacy risks associated with these uses of sensitive health and location tracking, we must ensure that it does not become the new normal.</p>

                  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian privacy law is now widely regarded as outdated and ill-equipped to address the emerging challenges that arise from the massive collection and use of personal information. Canada’s private sector privacy law was drafted in the 1990s, well before the advent of a data-driven economy and the need for reform has grown increasingly urgent as Canadian law falls behind comparable rules around the world.</p>
  <p>Guided by <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2019/05/the-foundation-of-canadas-digital-charter-privacy-law-reform-focused-on-a-data-driven-economy/">Canada’s Digital Charter</a>, a roadmap for reform released last spring, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains has promised to lead on privacy reform. While many may expect opposition to tougher privacy rules to come from large Internet companies such as Facebook, my <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-why-the-coming-battle-over-canadian-privacy-reform-starts-at-home/?cmpid=rss&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter#comments">Globe and Mail op-ed</a> notes that a recent report from the Business Council of Canada suggests that a bigger barrier may come from some of Canada’s largest companies, including big banks, airlines, retailers, insurance providers, and telecom giants.</p>
  <p>The Business Council report, <a href="https://thebusinesscouncil.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Data-Driven-Report.pdf">Data Driven: Canada’s Economic Opportunity</a>, is positioned as the Canadian corporate sector’s vision for creating a legal and policy framework to support both innovation and public trust through stronger privacy safeguards. Yet despite stating that a “foundation of trust requires a policy framework that ensures high levels of data protection”, its recommendations consistently advocate for a cautious approach that would leave Canada lagging behind.</p>
  <p>For example, Mr. Bains’ Digital Charter calls for stronger enforcement powers that include granting the Privacy Commissioner of Canada the power to order companies to stop non-compliant activities, increasing penalties, and establishing statutory damages for some offences. The Business Council has a much different vision, noting that its companies said the government should move “carefully” on the issue and cautioning “against adopting the overly prescriptive approach” found in the European Union.</p>
  <p>It therefore only recommends “providing the Office of the Privacy Commissioner with limited new powers to order organizations to cease activities that threaten imminent material harm to an individual.” That standard – limited power only in instances of imminent material harm – would render the Privacy Commissioner’s new order making power virtually meaningless.</p>
  <p>The report also warns that introducing new privacy rights requires caution or a limited implementation. For instance, it recommends only a “narrowly defined” right to data portability, which plays a central role in open banking by promising to put consumers in control over their own data through the right to have it transferred from one company to another. The recommendation would effectively limit the circumstances under which a company could be required to transfer the customer data.</p>
  <p>The same is true for the right to be forgotten, which would require the removal of search results that are “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant.” The Business Council is only willing to back a “limited right” for the right to be forgotten. Similarly, algorithmic transparency is supported only if “the requirement to do so is limited.”</p>
  <p>While the Business Council wants to limit new privacy rights, it seeks no limits on corporate transfers of personal information across borders. Indeed, the report argues that Canada is too small to establish a full requirement to store data domestically (known as data localization). It instead supports ensuring that all trade agreements feature a ban on data localization requirements.</p>
  <p>In fact, the report even recommends establishing new flexibilities around the notion of obtaining informed consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. As an alternative to statutory requirements, the report envisions the Privacy Commissioner of Canada working with the government to maintain a list of industry codes, standards, and certifications. Companies would be permitted to use compliance with these codes as evidence that they meet their privacy law obligations. If the approach becomes law, big businesses would be free to establish their own government-approved industry standards as equivalent to privacy law.</p>
  <p>Privacy has attracted increasing political attention in the new Parliament, with opposition parties repeatedly asking when the government intends to take legislative action to update the law. If the Business Council report is any indication, the privacy reform process will face a rough ride as the Canadian business establishment works to narrow new consumer rights and increased enforcement measures.</p>

                  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/INDU/meeting-4/minutes">released its recommendations</a> for changes to Bill C-4, the bill designed to implement the Canada-US-Mexico Trade Agreement. I <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/the-cusma-cost/">appeared before the committee</a> and used this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/03/lawbytes-podcast-episode-42/">Lawbytes podcast</a> to highlight some of the discussion. The committee had a limited time to study the bill, but arrived at some important recommendations on the copyright and digital policy provisions.</p>
  <p>First, it recommended adding a new exception to Canada&#8217;s digital lock rules to address concerns in the agriculture sector about the right to repair their equipment. The issue has been <a href="https://www.realagriculture.com/2020/03/ag-manufacturers-say-uneven-intellectual-property-rules-could-freeze-them-out-of-u-s-market/">gaining momentum</a> around the world as many identify the over-broad restrictions often associated with anti-circumvention laws. The recommendation:</p>
  <p><i>(9) Computer programs that are contained in and control the functioning of a lawfully acquired motorized land vehicle such as a personal automobile, commercial vehicle, or mechanized agricultural vehicle, except for programs accessed through a separate subscription service, when circumvention is a necessary step to allow the diagnosis, repair, or lawful modification of a vehicle function, where such circumvention does not constitute a violation of applicable law, including without limitation regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation or the Environmental Protection Agency, and is not accomplished for the purpose of gaining unauthorized access to other copyrighted works.</i></p>
  <p>Second, the committee highlighted concerns with the extension in the term of copyright and called on the government to embed within the bill the <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2019/06/the-authoritative-canadian-copyright-review-report-industry-committee/">recommendations arising from last year&#8217;s copyright review</a>. That would include using the 30 month implementation period for copyright term extension to establish a registration requirement for those rights holders that want to an additional 20 years to the international standard of life of the author plus 50 years.</p>
  <p>Third, the committee points to many digital law issues and &#8220;the lack of preparedness by the trade negotiation team&#8221;. The full statement:</p>
  <p><i>CUSMA also precludes Canada from making sovereign decisions on how it will deal with data protection, because the government has failed to establish a national data strategy in a timely fashion. This has the potential for massive negative impacts on the Canadian economy as the digital economy grows and potentially displaces other forms of industry as a primary source of global economic growth.</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>Other jurisdictions such as the EU have not entrenched provisions similar to those found in Chapter 19 of CUSMA because of the newness of the field and the need to have clear strategies around economic growth and regulation of data ownership prior to signing away sovereignty on the same.</i><i><br />
  </i><i>What particularly shocked our committee was the lack of preparedness by the trade negotiation team, in testimony, to explain what analysis and strategy was used by the government in making significant concessions in Chapter 19 of CUSMA. Given the failure of the government to draft a national strategy on the digital economy prior to signing off on CUSMA, the recommendations contained herein are particularly acute.</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>CUSMA also enshrines internet safe harbours, whereby internet companies are not liable for the content of their users. This restricts the ability for a country to create a system premised on liability for Internet companies. Additionally, the new trade agreement has raised uncertainties with regards to privacy laws and potential future reforms being contemplated and anticipated with regards digital consumer rights.</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>As such, we encourage you to look for ways to embed the following into Bill C-4:</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>• Clarify how anti-localization provisions will affect provinces like British Columbia and Nova Scotia who currently have data localization laws for things like financial information.</i><i><br />
  </i><i>• Study the impact of the data provisions in Chapter 19 of CUSMA on the Canadian economy with a specific focus on how they value of data.</i><i><br />
  </i><i>• On an urgent basis, create a National Data Strategy.</i><i><br />
  </i><i>• Provide an analysis on how the principle of internet safe harbours will impact the Government’s proposal to regulate online content.</i><i><br />
  </i><i>• Study and evaluate how future consumer protections in the digital services and telecom sectors could be impacted by CUSMA.</i><i><br />
  </i><i>• Establish mitigation measures to ensure future reforms and new authorities granted to the Privacy Commissioner to protect Canadians can sustain any challenges.</i><i><br />
  </i><i>• In order to accurately inform Canada’s policy response of the economic and non economic effects of the Intellectual Property (IP) and Data provisions of the CUSMA to effectively manage strategies that address the highly consequential nature this legislation has on all Canadians it is suggested that a clause be inserted into the legislation requiring a review of its effects as well as Canada’s policy strategies for the digital economy no later than 1 calendar year from those sections coming into force, with subsequent reviews taking place no later than every 2 calendar years thereafter. The review is to be conducted by the House of Commons and tabled in a timely manner in accordance with the review schedule. This, for example, could be included in Part 3 of the Act titled ‘Coming into Force’. It can be included as a subsection 5 or included as an additional clause at the end of each section requiring a 1 year review.</i></p>
  <p>The bill is currently being debated at third reading in the House of Commons.</p>

                  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cultural policy in Canada can be contentious, but there is one issue &#8211; support for Canadian content or Cancon &#8211; that unsurprisingly enjoys near unanimous backing. Given the economic benefits, federal and provincial policies encourage both domestic and foreign film and television production in Canada, but there is a special place for certified Canadian content, which is typically defended on the basis of the need to support cultural sovereignty by promoting “Canadian stories.”</p>
  <p>My <a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/2020/03/04/the-cancon-conundrum-why-policies-to-promote-canadian-stories-need-an-overhaul/238194">Hill Times op-ed</a> notes the emergence of streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ have sparked a massive inflow of film and television production in Canada. Ian Scott, the chair of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/01/a-demonstrably-false-premise/">notes</a> that Netflix is “probably the biggest single contributor to the [Canadian] production sector today”. The total value of the Canadian film and television production has nearly reached $9 billion annually, a record with overall production increasing in 2018 by 5.9 per cent.</p>
  <p>Despite the success, the <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/01/the-crtc-knows-best/">Broadcast and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel Report</a> &#8211; the so-called Yale Report &#8211; maintains that the record-setting production in Canada does not meet the cultural goals of ensuring production of certified Canadian content. At the report launch, Yale said measures are needed so Canada can “continue to assert its cultural sovereignty and Canadians can continue to express their identity and culture through content.”</p>
  <p>The Yale Report seeks to address the issue by recommending that Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault overhaul Canadian communications law, including regulation of Internet sites and services around the world. Yet the panel strangely does not touch the issue of what constitutes Canadian content, dismissing the foundational policy issue in a half-sentence by remarking that “it is time to review the model for supporting Canadian content, but not the definition of Canadian content.”</p>
  <p>Not only does the panel <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/broadcast-panel-commissioned-report-found-canada-ranks-first-among-peer-countries-in-tv-production-domestic-tv-production-and-employment-per-capita/">ignore industry data</a> it commissioned that found Canada ranks first per capita among peer countries in spending on domestic production, but by failing to grapple with the definition of Canadian content, it avoids coming to terms with the not-so-secret reality that Canadian content is often indistinguishable from foreign location and service production.</p>
  <p>I recently launched a <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/btlrcanconquiz/">“Cancon quiz”</a> in which users were asked to identify Canadian content from among 20 film and television productions. With nearly 2,000 quiz takers, only a handful of participants managed to guess all 20 correctly. The results should not come as a surprise. Qualifying as certified Canadian content requires having a Canadian producer along with meeting a strict point system that rewards granting roles such as the director, screenwriter, lead actors, and music composer to Canadians. It is checklist approach that is ultimately a poor proxy for “telling our stories.”</p>
  <p>The challenge is that the Cancon rules are premised on three competing objectives which do not mesh easily together into a single policy.</p>
  <p>The first objective posits Cancon as a cultural policy that preserves and promotes Canadian stories. The current approach is woefully ineffective in this regard. Programs such as The Handmaid’s Tale may be based on a Margaret Atwood novel, but using one of Canada’s best known novelists as the source doesn’t count in the Canadian points system. Meanwhile, “co-productions”, in which treaty agreements deem predominantly foreign productions as Cancon (enabling the Norwegian language film Hevn to qualify as Canadian) almost completely sever the link between certification and Canadian stories.</p>
  <p>The second objective envisions Cancon as economic policy designed to create jobs and facilitate local investment. Yet other than a handful of specific industry jobs, there are few economic differences between Cancon and foreign productions. Indeed, governments and industry tout the economic benefits of both equally since the overwhelming majority of job opportunities are the same.</p>
  <p>The third objective is Cancon as intellectual property policy, which adopts the position that producers must be Canadian to ensure control over the global rights. This leads to rules that preclude foreign companies from producing Cancon and requiring domestic IP ownership. As a result, revivals of Canadian programs such as Trailer Park Boys do not meet the qualification requirements if Netflix is the sole funder and producer. Further, the Yale Report recommendations would require foreign companies to invest in Cancon but cultural policies restrict their ability to actually own the IP, setting up the possibility of a trade challenge under CUSMA.</p>
  <p>There is nothing wrong with wanting to promote Canadian stories, facilitate job creation, and enhance intellectual property ownership. But if the goal is Canadian stories, the current policy needs to be revamped to better reflect those cultural goals. If it’s economic policy, there is no reason to distinguish between investment in domestic or foreign productions. If it’s IP, Canada can’t both require foreign investment in Cancon and restrict IP ownership. Before the government leaps into a controversial communications law overhaul, it need to get its Cancon story straight.</p>

The effort was largely an attempt to reiterate its <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2019/09/can-price-caps-or-virtual-competitors-solve-canadas-wireless-pricing-problem/">wireless affordability platform</a>, which targeted a 25 per cent reduction in consumer wireless bills by emphasizing more competition through MVNOs and spectrum set-asides. The renewed emphasis on the policy comes as an updated Wall Report finds that prices have been declining in some baskets (the long-overdue emergence of unlimited-ish plans a key factor), but not in the core middle tier of plans where prices remain high. The government states &#8220;<span class="s1">Canadians have been paying more overall compared to consumers in other G7 countries and Australia&#8221; and </span>noted that the government will track pricing on a quarterly basis starting from January 2020. Coming on the heels of <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/who-runs-canadian-telecom-policy-anyway-why-the-telus-threats-at-the-crtc-will-backfire/">threats from incumbent telecom companies</a> such as Telus, it was good for the government to re-assert its policy objectives for the sector.</p>
  <p>Yet despite the Bains&#8217; policy plans, there is a new issue that he has thus far failed to address. Much of the focus of the <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/110.nsf/eng/00012.html">Broadcast and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel report</a> has been on its call for a massive overhaul of Canadian communications law with increased <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/higher-costs-and-less-choice/">consumer costs</a>, <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/not-neutral-why-the-broadcast-panel-report-weakens-net-neutrality-in-canada/">violation of net neutrality</a>, CRTC intervention into <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/the-broadcast-panel-report-and-discoverability-of-canadian-content-searching-for-evidence-of-a-problem/">discoverability</a>, and <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/03/the-cusma-culture-poison-pill/">USMCA violations</a>. The goal of these reforms is to enhance support for the creation of Canadian content.</p>
  <p>There has been less attention paid to a series of additional recommendations focused on the telecommunications sector. There are some useful recommendations, but there is also an expansive regulatory vision for the CRTC on communications, sweeping up thousands of services around the world even without a presence in Canada. Those services would be required to register with the CRTC and pay a broadband tax to fund access in Canada. The vision starts with a recommendation to expand the scope of regulation:</p>
  <p><i>Recommendation 16: We recommend that the definitions in the Telecommunications Act be amended to replace “telecommunications service” with “electronic communications service,” which means a service provided by means of telecommunications facilities and, without limitation, includes: </i><i><br />
  </i></p>
  <ul>
  <li><i>the provision in whole or in part of telecommunications facilities and any related equipment by sale, lease, or otherwise; </i></li>
  <li><i>connectivity service, a service whose principal feature is the conveyance of intelligence by means of telecommunications facilities; and </i></li>
  <li><i>interpersonal communications service, a service that enables direct interpersonal and interactive exchange of information via telecommunications facilities between a finite number of persons. The persons initiating or participating in the communication determine its recipients.</i></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Having expanded telecommunications service to electronic communications service, the panel then recommends that the CRTC have jurisdiction over all services, whether located in Canada or outside the country:</p>
  <p><i>Recommendation 19: We recommend that the Telecommunications Act be amended to establish explicit jurisdiction over all persons and entities providing, or offering to provide, electronic communications services in Canada, even if they do not have a place of business in Canada. </i></p>
  <p>The combination of the two recommendations means that Internet services such as WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, FaceTime, Zoom, and hundreds of others would all be captured by Canadian regulation and subject to the jurisdiction of the CRTC. The BTLR recommends that all these providers be required to register with the Commission and pay levies into a fund to support Canadian broadband. Recommendation 25 states:</p>
  <p><i>We recommend that the Telecommunications Act be amended to enable the CRTC to draw from an expanded range of market participants &#8211; all providers of electronic communications services &#8211; in designating required contributors to funds to ensure access to advanced telecommunications. </i></p>
  <p>Bains and the government should not underestimate the implications of this recommendation to the affordability of communications services. Both <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2018/12/minister-bains-comments-on-crtc-announcement-on-lower-cost-data-only-mobile-wireless-plans.html">Bains</a> and the <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/phone/mobile/dat.htm">CRTC</a> have emphasized the importance of low-cost data only plans to expand affordable access for Canadians. The vision is that a low-cost data only plan allows consumers to rely on Internet-based messaging services for their communications requirements. Many of those services are available for free to consumers.</p>
  <p>Yet despite the enormous benefits of free communications services that expand affordable access, the BTLR wants to increase the costs of providing those services to Canadians with new regulatory requirements and mandated payments to fund broadband in Canada. Leaving aside how Canadian-based services would react to a U.S. requirement to fund broadband there, the possibility of increasing those costs to Canadians is enormously troubling and runs directly counter to Bains&#8217; emphasis on consumer affordability for communications services.</p>

                  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/110.nsf/eng/00012.html">Broadcast and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel report</a> calls for a massive overhaul of Canadian communications law including significant changes to the CRTC that even include a name change to the Canadian Communications Commission. Yet more significant &#8211; and seemingly more controversial &#8211; is a change to the requirements for commissioners. The current CRTC Act provides for the creation of regional commissioners, who must reside in their region with the expectation that they are better positioned to raise regional concerns. The panel recommends dropping regional commissioners altogether, requiring instead that all commissioners reside in the Ottawa/Gatineau region:</p>
  <p><i>Recommendation 4: We recommend that sections 3, 5, 6, and 10.1 of the CRTC Act be amended to reduce the maximum number of Commissioners to a Chair, a Vice-Chair, and up to seven additional Commissioners, each appointed for a single term of up to seven years. For the term of their appointment, Commissioners should reside in the National Capital Region or within a prescribed distance thereof.</i></p>
  <p>That recommendation has sparked anger among some Members of Parliament. Conservative MP Martin Shields <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/CHPC/meeting-2/evidence">raised the issue</a> with panel chair Janet Yale at the Canadian Heritage Committee:</p>
  <p><i>Ms. Janet Yale: We thought a lot about what it takes to have effective collegial decision-making and how we can enhance the collegiality and effectiveness of decision-making at the CRTC, which is embodied in recommendation 4. However, we recognize that in terms of ensuring the CRTC has a broad perspective on what the interests, views and Canadians from all different sectors and parts of the country are, including accessibility requirements, linguistic diversity and diversity of other types, we recommended the formation of a public interest committee of up to 25 members, whose composition would enable the CRTC to have that broader perspective.</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>Mr. Martin Shields: I got that, but when you read number 4, do you know what that says to me? It says that you&#8217;ve just excluded my part of the country as being able to participate, and I have a real, real problem with that. That&#8217;s what it says to me. I read that, I know what you just said, but you just excluded the vast majority of the country when you said that.</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>Ms. Janet Yale: It&#8217;s up to nine commissioners with broad representation from different parts of the country. The only change we&#8217;ve made is really that they should be required to live in the national capital region for the term of their office, because—</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>Mr. Martin Shields: I understand where you&#8217;re going with this, but understand—</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>Ms. Janet Yale: However, that doesn&#8217;t exclude people from different parts of the country. It just says that it&#8217;s very hard for the CRTC, with commissioners based in the region, for them to really build relationships of trust and collaboration. It does not exclude people based on their geography.</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i>Mr. Martin Shields: You&#8217;re telling me I have to move here. You&#8217;re telling me I have to move to be part of it; I have to move to the central part of Canada, the capital region. That&#8217;s not what I accept. I don&#8217;t accept that. That exclude people and is discriminatory against where I live. You say I have to move here to be part of this process. If you don&#8217;t understand where I&#8217;m from, you don&#8217;t understand the flames that statement creates, and you have to be very, very careful how you write things like that.</i></p>
  <p>It would appear that the panel hopes that a public interest committee will address the representation concerns, but Shields was not having it. In fact, he raised the issue again days later in the House of Commons during <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/house/sitting-26/hansard">question period</a>:</p>
  <p><i>Mr. Martin Shields (Bow River, CPC): Madam Speaker, the new CRTC guidelines in the Yale report that the minister is reviewing are deeply flawed. I have strong concerns about the journalists being licensed and registered. I am also very frustrated about Yale report recommendation number four that would have nine board members live or move to Ottawa for seven years. That is discriminatory to western Canada and just plain wrong. Will the government commit to rejecting recommendation number four of the Yale report or will the government continue to alienate western Canada?</i><i><br />
  </i><i><br />
  </i><i> Ms. Julie Dabrusin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): Madam Speaker, our government thanks the members of the Yale report for the work they did. The panel has undertaken a wonderful final report, and we are looking at the recommendations in the report and plan to take action as swiftly as possible. The report recommendations that are proposed are all being considered, and we support a strong, competitive broadcasting media sector. We intend to move swiftly to ensure all players, including web giants, support Canadian culture. We are reviewing them and are looking at them right now.</i></p>
  <p>It is notable that the final Broadcast panel featured no representatives from Western Canada. In fact, with the resignation of Hank Intven before the panel began crafting its recommendations, it was left with six members, all of whom reside in Ontario and Quebec. For a government without elected MPs from either Saskatchewan and Alberta, racing toward legislative reform premised on greater CRTC powers and eliminating regional representation may carry significant political risk.</p>

Ontario Creates <a href="http://www.ontariocreates.ca/Assets/Design+Assets/Homepage+Marketing+Panel/Feb2020/NewsProdStats2019_En.pdf">touted</a> a &#8220;record breaking year&#8221; for Ontario&#8217;s film and television production sector, citing more than $2 billion in production spending for 343 productions. Of the $2.1 billion, there was a near-even split between domestic and foreign production: $1.1 billion in foreign production and $1 billion on domestic productions.</p>
  <p>Janet Yale, the panel chair, recently <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/CHPC/meeting-2/evidence">told the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage</a>:</p>
  <p><i>The main distinction we were trying to draw was between service productions and productions that count as contributing to Canadian culture. Service productions are great in the sense that there are jobs created, there is employment, there is production capacity, and it&#8217;s great for the Canadian economy. We don&#8217;t want to take away anything from the contributions that have been made by organizations like Netflix and other, that have decided to invest in Canada to make those service productions.</i></p>
  <p><em>That has nothing to do with cultural policy because the key creative positions; the writers, the actors, and directors are not held by Canadians. If we&#8217;re trying to make sure that in a world of endless choices and voices that there are Canadian choices, then those productions that we&#8217;re saying they should invest in, must meet the definition of Canadian content, in which case the key creative positions, for them to meet the Canadian content criteria, would have to be held by Canadians.</em></p>
  <p>I&#8217;ve pointed out in my <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/02/btlrcanconquiz/">Cancon quiz</a> that identifying what counts as &#8220;certified&#8221; Canadian content can be difficult. Yet the data from Ontario demonstrates that even when identified as Canadian, there is no crisis. In fact, the opposite is true with record breaking domestic production numbers taking place without the panel&#8217;s onerous, intrusive, and unnecessary recommendations to extend regulations to the Internet sites and services around the world.</p>
